\subsection*{ping sensor}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item stores trigger pin number
\item stores echo pin number
\item gives distance
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{world}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 2d linked-\/list of squares
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{square}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item number of times scanned
\item number of times object found here
\item linked list of coordinates that this square has been scanned from
\item x coordinate
\item y coordinate
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{mysql}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item stores maps from each run
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{threads}

in order of priority


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 1 thread for bump sensors
\item 1 main thread
\item 1 thread for movement
\item 4 threads for ping sensors
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item they will alternate between sensors
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item 1 thread for processing sensor data
\item 1 thread for finding best path
\item 1 thread for machine learning 
\end{DoxyItemize}
